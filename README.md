As a budding chemical engineer, I quickly fell in love with automating tasks to free up my--and eventually, my colleagues'--time and improve overall work quality. As my programming "hobby" progressed, I graduated from VBA macros and began diving into the wonderful world of Python. 

Fast forward to today, I am regularly using C#, Python, and SQL to solve everyday problems for my company and our customers. Throughout my learning journey, I have used programming to automate daily reports, perform hierarchical data validation, elevate the functionality of process data historians, perform analyses on stock and option market data, optimize fantasy football lineups, and much more. Looking forward, my goal is to focus on some larger-scale, personal projects that further my skillset as a developer, while helping me (and possibly others!) solve some real-world problems.
